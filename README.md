# Asteroids
This is a recreation of the classic game Asteroids. The goal is to survive, while blowing up as many asteroids as possible. I will be expanding this with a score tracker, but for now it's just the basic game.

## Controls
<ul>
<li>W - Move forward</li>
<li>A - Move back</li>
<li>S - Move left</li>
<li>D - Move right</li>
<li>SPACE - Shoot</li>
</ul>
